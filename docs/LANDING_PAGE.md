# Friday Landing Page Build Prompt

Build a polished, responsive product landing page for **Friday**, a cross-platform desktop AI copilot that turns conversations into actions and turns useful work into reusable knowledge.

This document is the source prompt for the page. Use the approved positioning and copy below. Keep every product claim consistent with the current implementation, especially the distinctions between Skills, the Knowledge Base, the LLM Wiki, and Extensions.

## Page objective

The page should help a technically curious knowledge worker, developer, researcher, or AI power user understand three things within the first screen:

1. Friday is a desktop agent that can act, not just chat.
2. Friday can reuse workflows and ground answers in the user's own material.
3. The user chooses the providers, knowledge sources, and extensions behind the experience.

The primary conversion is downloading Friday. The secondary conversion is viewing the project on GitHub. Documentation is the tertiary path.

Use these destinations unless the host project provides equivalent route constants:

- **Download Friday:** `https://github.com/HaraldBregu/friday/releases`
- **View on GitHub:** `https://github.com/HaraldBregu/friday`
- **Read the docs:** `https://github.com/HaraldBregu/friday/tree/main/docs`

Do not add pricing, testimonials, customer logos, usage counters, or a newsletter form. No verified source material exists for them.

## Product positioning

**Category:** desktop AI copilot and tool-using personal agent.

**Existing product tagline:** Your desktop AI copilot for everyday tasks.

**Landing-page promise:** Friday connects action, reusable expertise, source-grounded retrieval, durable knowledge, and focused mini-apps in one desktop assistant.

**Core narrative:**

```text
Ask Friday to do the work
  -> activate the right reusable Skill
  -> retrieve evidence from the Knowledge Base
  -> build on durable knowledge in the LLM Wiki
  -> use focused Extensions when the workflow needs a dedicated interface
```

Use the user-facing name **Knowledge Base** in navigation and marketing copy. Introduce **RAG** once as the underlying retrieval approach for technical readers. Keep **LLM Wiki** as the feature name.

## Approved page structure and copy

### 1. Navigation

Use a compact sticky navigation bar.

- Friday logo and wordmark on the left.
- Anchor links: **Product**, **Skills**, **Knowledge**, **Extensions**, **Control**.
- Secondary action: **GitHub**.
- Primary action: **Download**.

On mobile, preserve the Download action and move anchor links into an accessible menu.

### 2. Hero

**Eyebrow**

```text
Desktop AI copilot for macOS, Windows, and Linux
```

**Headline**

```text
Turn conversations into action. Turn your work into lasting knowledge.
```

**Supporting copy**

```text
Friday works with your files, tools, and chosen AI providers—then makes the useful parts reusable through Skills, semantic document search, a source-aware LLM Wiki, and custom Extensions.
```

**Actions**

- Primary: **Download Friday**
- Secondary: **View on GitHub**

**Supporting line**

```text
Bring your own providers. Keep control of the setup. Follow every tool action in the conversation.
```

Show four concise capability labels near the hero visual:

- Reusable Skills
- Semantic Knowledge Base
- Source-aware LLM Wiki
- Custom Extensions

The hero visual should look like the real Friday desktop application, not a generic browser chat mockup. Show one request moving through visible activity states such as loading a skill, searching knowledge, reading a wiki page, and updating a local file. Do not invent a marketplace, team workspace, or autonomous background task result.

### 3. Product foundation

**Section heading**

```text
One assistant, from request to result.
```

**Section copy**

```text
Type or speak a request, attach images or PDFs, and let Friday work across files, commands, the web, browser interactions, and generated media. Tool activity streams into the conversation, while permission controls govern sensitive file and command actions.
```

Present a short four-step flow:

1. **Ask** — Start with a natural-language request and the context that matters.
2. **Act** — Friday selects tools, works through the task, and shows its activity.
3. **Ground** — The assistant retrieves relevant source excerpts or compiled wiki knowledge.
4. **Reuse** — Save the workflow as a Skill or give it a focused interface through an Extension.

Use this section as context, not as a complete inventory of every Friday feature.

### 4. Skills

Set the section anchor to `skills`.

**Eyebrow**

```text
Reusable expertise
```

**Heading**

```text
Teach Friday the way you work.
```

**Body copy**

```text
Turn repeatable workflows into portable Agent Skills. Friday routes requests with lightweight skill metadata, loads the full instructions only when they are relevant, and can use the scripts, references, and assets bundled with each skill.
```

**Feature points**

- Import agentskills.io-compatible folders built around `SKILL.md`.
- Let Friday select an enabled skill by intent, or request one explicitly.
- Inspect a skill's identity, authoring metadata, tool requirements, connectors, and tags.
- Enable, disable, download, refresh, or delete local skills from Settings.
- See a clear activity state in chat whenever Friday loads a skill.

**Supporting callout**

```text
Full instructions arrive only when the task needs them—reusable expertise without placing every playbook into every prompt.
```

For the visual, show the installed Skills list beside a chat activity row that reads **Using skill**. Optional supporting files may appear as small script, reference, and asset cards. Do not imply that Friday includes a skill marketplace, a visual skill builder, semantic skill search, or runtime enforcement of every declared metadata field.

### 5. Knowledge system

Set the section anchor to `knowledge`.

**Eyebrow**

```text
Retrieval plus durable knowledge
```

**Heading**

```text
Find the source. Keep the insight.
```

**Intro copy**

```text
Friday uses two complementary knowledge layers. The Knowledge Base retrieves relevant excerpts from indexed text. The LLM Wiki turns changing source material into structured, interlinked Markdown that can be checked, reviewed, and reused.
```

Present the two features as equal, connected panels rather than competing products.

#### Knowledge Base

**Card heading**

```text
Search your documents by meaning.
```

**Card copy**

```text
Choose one or more folders of text, create a semantic index with your selected embedding provider and Pinecone, and let Friday retrieve matching excerpts with their source paths. Generate the index on demand, keep it refreshed on a schedule, and test searches directly in Settings.
```

**Feature points**

- Recursively indexes readable UTF-8 text while skipping binary files.
- Uses the same embedding model for indexing and later queries.
- Gives the main assistant relevant excerpts, paths, and relevance scores.
- Supports manual generation and scheduled full index rebuilds.
- Rejects common credential files and high-confidence secret content before indexing.

Use **Knowledge Base** in the interface. A small technical label may say **RAG-powered semantic retrieval**. Do not describe this feature as local-only, incremental, compatible with PDFs or office documents, or independent of Pinecone.

#### LLM Wiki

**Card heading**

```text
Build knowledge that improves as sources change.
```

**Card copy**

```text
Compile Markdown, text, JSON, CSV, and log files into a persistent, interlinked Markdown wiki. Friday preserves source evidence, maintains traceable claims and contradictions, validates every staged update, and incrementally skips sources that have not changed.
```

**Feature points**

- Generates concise source, concept, topic, project, comparison, synthesis, and question pages.
- Records source-aware claims, confidence, relationships, contradictions, and open questions.
- Keeps immutable evidence snapshots and an append-only operation log.
- Stages and validates updates before atomically replacing the generated wiki.
- Supports manual generation, cancellation, scheduled maintenance, linting, and review for major synthesis rewrites.
- Stores the generated wiki as ordinary Markdown in a user-selected local folder.

**Supporting callout**

```text
The wiki gives Friday durable synthesis. Raw evidence and the Knowledge Base remain available when an answer needs exact wording or broader retrieval.
```

For the visual, show source files flowing into interlinked Markdown pages with small evidence, confidence, and contradiction markers. Avoid depicting the wiki as vector search or claiming that every high-impact change always requires review.

#### Knowledge comparison

Preserve this distinction in both copy and visuals:

|               | Knowledge Base                               | LLM Wiki                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Best for      | Finding relevant source excerpts             | Maintaining reusable synthesis and relationships      |
| Input         | Readable text across selected folders        | Markdown, text, JSON, CSV, and logs                   |
| Processing    | Remote embeddings and Pinecone vector search | Selected text model and validated Markdown generation |
| Result        | Ranked excerpts with paths and scores        | Interlinked pages with source-aware claims            |
| Refresh model | Manual or scheduled full rebuild             | Incremental source-aware compilation                  |

### 6. Extensions

Set the section anchor to `extensions`.

**Eyebrow**

```text
Focused interfaces
```

**Heading**

```text
Make Friday fit the workflow.
```

**Body copy**

```text
Extensions are local web mini-apps that open in their own Friday windows and can use the exposed app API. Build a focused interface for a dashboard, workspace utility, or repeatable workflow without turning the main conversation into a control panel.
```

**Feature points**

- Import one or more extension folders from Settings.
- Use a validated `manifest.json` or standard `package.json` with a local HTML entry.
- Browse installed apps by title, description, and category.
- Inspect metadata, open an extension in a dedicated resizable window, or delete it with confirmation.
- Launch installed extensions from Settings, the native app menu, or the tray menu.
- Build typed in-app integrations with `@friday/sdk`.

**Trust note**

```text
Extensions run in Electron's sandboxed web runtime, but installed code can access broad Friday APIs. Install extensions only from sources you trust.
```

For the visual, show the installed Extensions list opening a separate utility window. Do not claim an extension marketplace, signed extensions, per-extension permissions, enable/disable controls, or hot reload of an already-open extension window.

### 7. Control and privacy

Set the section anchor to `control`.

**Heading**

```text
Your setup. Your providers. Your control.
```

**Body copy**

```text
Friday stores provider keys, settings, conversations, workspace data, Skills, Extensions, and generated wiki files on the user's machine. The user selects the providers and connected services behind chat, speech, media, search, embeddings, and knowledge generation.
```

**Control points**

- File writes, edits, patches, and command execution follow the agent permission policy.
- Sensitive actions can surface **Deny**, **Allow once**, and **Always allow** choices.
- Tool activity remains visible in the conversation.
- The app uses Electron sandboxing, context isolation, disabled Node integration, and web security.
- Friday runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux, with light, dark, and system themes.

Include this disclosure in readable body text, not hidden in a tooltip or footer:

```text
Local storage does not mean every operation stays on-device. Prompts, attachments, source text, document chunks, and tool data may be sent to the AI providers, Pinecone index, MCP servers, websites, or other connected services required for a requested feature.
```

Do not use **fully private**, **offline**, **on-device AI**, **zero data leaves your machine**, **end-to-end encrypted**, **enterprise-grade security**, or regulatory-certification claims.

### 8. Final call to action

**Heading**

```text
Build an assistant around the way you work.
```

**Supporting copy**

```text
Start with a conversation. Add the skills, knowledge, providers, and extensions that make Friday yours.
```

**Actions**

- Primary: **Download Friday**
- Secondary: **Explore the source**

Add a compact platform line: **Available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Open source under the MIT License.**

### 9. Footer

Include links for GitHub, Documentation, Releases, Security, Contributing, and License. Keep the footer simple and use the repository as the source of truth.

## Visual direction

Use Friday's existing product identity rather than generic AI imagery.

- Use `resources/icons/icon-rounded.png` as the primary brand mark.
- Start with near-black or deep graphite foundations and restrained off-white surfaces.
- Pull electric violet, magenta, and blue accents from the icon for focus rings, active paths, and small glows.
- Mirror the desktop application's clean borders, compact controls, calm spacing, and rounded panels.
- Let the neon accent signal intelligence moving through the system; do not cover every card in gradients or glass effects.
- Prefer real product UI compositions, source-page diagrams, file cards, tool activity, and extension windows over abstract brains, robots, stock photos, or floating chat bubbles.
- Use a modern sans-serif for interface and marketing copy and a restrained monospace for paths, commands, evidence IDs, and technical labels.

The page should feel capable, precise, and personal. Avoid a noisy cyberpunk aesthetic even though the icon is luminous.

## Motion and interaction

- Use subtle scroll reveals and short transitions only where they clarify the product flow.
- Animate the hero activity sequence once, then settle into a readable final state.
- Let the Knowledge section visually branch into retrieval and wiki compilation, then reconnect at the answer.
- Make cards respond gently to hover without large tilts, parallax, or cursor-following effects.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and keep all content available without animation.

## Responsive and accessibility requirements

- Use semantic landmarks and one page-level H1.
- Preserve the content order and messaging hierarchy on mobile.
- Meet WCAG AA contrast for text, controls, focus indicators, and links.
- Make navigation, menus, and calls to action fully keyboard accessible.
- Do not rely on color alone to distinguish Skills, Knowledge Base, LLM Wiki, and Extensions.
- Give product images meaningful alternative text; mark decorative glow and connector elements as decorative.
- Keep paragraph width readable and avoid horizontal scrolling at 320 CSS pixels.

## SEO metadata

**Title**

```text
Friday — Desktop AI that turns knowledge into action
```

**Description**

```text
Friday is a cross-platform desktop AI copilot with reusable Skills, a source-aware LLM Wiki, semantic document search, and custom Extensions.
```

Use the same core message for Open Graph and social metadata. Use the Friday icon or a product-composition image, not a fabricated customer or performance statistic.

## Accuracy guardrails

The finished page must not imply capabilities that are only planned, partial, or absent.

- Do not claim a hosted service, team collaboration, multi-tenant knowledge, or cloud account sync.
- Do not claim that all AI or knowledge processing happens locally.
- Do not call the Knowledge Base incremental; current indexing rebuilds its Pinecone index.
- Do not claim arbitrary vector-database support; the current runtime uses Pinecone.
- Do not present the LLM Wiki as semantic vector search or as a replacement for the Knowledge Base.
- Do not claim that wiki answers are automatically filed by default.
- Do not claim a Skills or Extensions marketplace.
- Do not claim that every Skill metadata declaration is enforced at runtime.
- Do not claim that Extensions are signed, verified, permission-isolated, or safe to install from untrusted sources.
- Do not advertise extension hot reload, enable/disable controls, or preinstalled example extensions.
- Do not market incomplete scheduled-agent execution, realtime voice conversation, or database features on this page.
- Do not invent download counts, supported-company logos, benchmarks, customer quotes, or awards.

## Acceptance criteria

The landing page is complete when:

- The hero explains Friday's category, action capability, and knowledge advantage without scrolling.
- Skills, Knowledge Base, LLM Wiki, and Extensions each receive a distinct, implementation-accurate explanation.
- The relationship between retrieval and compiled wiki knowledge is visually and verbally clear.
- The privacy section distinguishes local storage from processing by configured external services.
- Primary and secondary calls to action are visible in the hero and final section.
- The result works across desktop, tablet, and mobile and meets the accessibility requirements above.
- No section depends on fabricated social proof, placeholder statistics, or unimplemented product behavior.
