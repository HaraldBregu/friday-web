# Channels Page

Route: `/channels/`

Source: `src/pages/channels.astro`

## Purpose

The channels page lists messaging channels supported by Friday and separates bundled runtime channels from catalog channels. It also explains DM policy modes and the inbound message flow.

## Content Sources

- Channel catalog data comes from `src/data/channels.json`.
- Runtime grouping is computed from each channel's `runtime` value.
- DM labels and inbound-flow copy are defined in `src/pages/channels.astro`.
- Shared UI uses `src/components/CTASection.astro`, `src/components/Icon.astro`, and `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.

## Feature Docs Used

- `/Users/haraldbregu/Documents/friday/docs/features/channels.md`
- `/Users/haraldbregu/Documents/friday/docs/features/connectors.md`

## Notes

The feature docs identify Telegram as the bundled local runtime. Other listed channels are catalog-only until a runtime adapter is registered. Keep the page copy clear that channel accounts, allow-lists, DM policy, delivery targets, and adapter state determine whether a channel can receive and send messages.
