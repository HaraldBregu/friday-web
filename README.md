# Friday Static Marketing Site

Astro static marketing site for Friday, a local-first desktop AI assistant for
chat, files, tools, connected apps, scheduled tasks, channels, and voice-assisted
workflows.

The home page is built from Astro components, JSON data, custom CSS, and a small
vanilla JavaScript demo. It intentionally does not use React, Tailwind, or a
client-side UI framework.

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run preview
```

## Deploying to Vercel

The repository includes `vercel.json` so Vercel can build the static Astro
site with Bun and serve the generated `dist` directory.

Recommended Vercel settings:

- Framework Preset: `Astro`
- Install Command: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- Build Command: `bun run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`

Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in Vercel to the final production URL, for example
`https://friday.example.com`. If it is not set, the build falls back to Vercel's
deployment URL and then to the placeholder URL in `astro.config.mjs`.

## Customization Notes

- Global colors, spacing, typography, borders, and shadows live in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Reusable content lives in `src/data/*.json`.
- The main landing page content is in `src/data/friday-product.json`.
- Blog posts are Markdown files in `src/content/blog`.
- SEO defaults, Open Graph image, canonical URLs, and theme initialization are handled in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
- The site is configured for static output in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Optional analytics can be added in `Layout.astro` near the closing `body` tag, then removed without touching page components.
