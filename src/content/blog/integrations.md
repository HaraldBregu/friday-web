Integrations work best when they are small, inspectable, and easy to replace.
The sample data in this site is intentionally plain JSON so the public product
surface stays simple while the real adapter layer evolves.

## Useful categories

Most teams need a few core categories first: code hosting, communication
channels, productivity tools, data sources, and infrastructure.

## Keep copy close to data

The landing page, integrations page, and footer all read from reusable data
files. That makes it easier to replace placeholder copy without touching the
component structure.
