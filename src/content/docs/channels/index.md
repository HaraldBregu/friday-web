This document describes Friday's messaging channel subsystem: the catalog shown
in Settings, the shared channel configuration model, the main-process registry,
the unified agent gateway contract, and the currently bundled Telegram runtime.

The source-of-truth files are:

- `src/shared/channels.ts` for channel ids, shared config types, and runtime
  status events.
- `src/shared/channel-catalog.ts` for catalog metadata, aliases, docs paths,
  visibility, setup visibility, markdown capability, and brand icon ids.
- `src/main/channels/registry.ts` for plugin registration, runtime factory
  registration, adapter lifecycle, inbound dispatch, outbound sends, and status
  broadcasts.
- `src/main/channels/telegram/plugin.ts` and
  `src/main/channels/telegram/adapter.ts` for the reference runtime.

## Catalog

Friday maintains a channel catalog with stable channel ids, labels,
aliases, UI ordering, markdown support, exposure, and docs paths. Aliases such
as `lark`, `gchat`, `google-chat`, `imsg`, `internet-relay-chat`, `teams`,
`nc-talk`, `nc`, `twitch-chat`, `zl`, and `zlu` resolve to their canonical ids.

The channel ids below link to the per-channel markdown files used by the
catalog docs path.

Only `telegram` has a bundled runtime. All other entries are catalog-only
plugins with disabled runtime capabilities. Catalog-only channels can still be
configured in Settings so the UI, stored config, future runtime work, and docs
all share stable ids.

Catalog metadata rules:

- `docsPath` must point at the matching file under `docs/channels/`.
- `docsLabel` defaults to `<label> setup`.
- `setupVisible` and `catalogVisible` default to `false` only for hidden
  entries.
- `qa-channel` is hidden and is for tests, not the Settings catalog.
- `brandIconId` is currently set for Discord, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and
  Slack. Matching light and dark icon assets must exist under
  `resources/icons/brands/<brandIconId>/`.
- `markdownCapable` records provider capability for future runtime work. It
  does not mean a catalog-only provider can currently send or render messages.

## Configuration Model

The stored channel state is a `Channel` object keyed by `ChannelType`. Each
channel has an `enabled` flag, a `defaultAccountId`, and optional `accounts`.
Account config uses `ChannelAccountProperties`:

- `label`
- `enabled`
- `token`, `secret`, `clientSecret`
- `serverUrl`, `webhookUrl`
- `appId`, `clientId`, `username`, `phoneNumber`, `botUserId`
- `allowFrom`
- `groupAllowFrom`
- `defaultTarget`
- `dmPolicy`
- `heartbeat`

`StoreService` creates default channel config for every catalog id. Telegram,
WhatsApp, and Discord have first-class top-level config shapes because they need
common token, allowlist, and account fields. Other channels use the generic
account map.

All channels default to disabled with `defaultAccountId: "default"`. The stored
default direct-message policy is `allowlist`, so an empty `allowFrom` list
denies direct messages unless a user explicitly changes `dmPolicy` to `open`.
Catalog-only plugins still report their accounts as unconfigured until a runtime
implementation exists.

Treat all token, secret, webhook, and client credential fields as secrets. Do
not log them, add them to docs examples as real values, commit them, or include
them in agent-visible output. The Telegram plugin also advertises
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and secret assignment paths for future secret-store work.

The Settings detail view writes the same shared account fields for every
channel. Phone-number inputs are shown for iMessage, LINE, QQ Bot, Signal,
Telegram, WhatsApp, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. Server URL inputs are shown for
Discord, Feishu, Google Chat, IRC, Matrix, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams,
Nextcloud Talk, Nostr, Slack, Synology Chat, Tlon, and Twitch.

## Renderer IPC API

The preload layer exposes `window.channels`:

| Method | IPC channel | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listCatalog()` | `channels:catalog` | Return the shared catalog entries. |
| `getConfig()` | `channels:get-config` | Return the full stored channel config. |
| `getChannelConfig(type)` | `channels:get-channel-config` | Return one channel config by id. |
| `saveChannelConfig(type, config)` | `channels:save-channel-config` | Normalize and persist one channel config. Telegram saves also reconfigure the registry. |
| `getStatus(type?)` | `channels:get-status` | Return cached runtime status. Defaults to Telegram when omitted. |
| `getTelegramConfig()` | `channels:telegram:get-config` | Compatibility helper for Telegram config. |
| `saveTelegramConfig(config)` | `channels:telegram:save-config` | Compatibility helper that normalizes and persists Telegram config. |
| `getTelegramStatus()` | `channels:telegram:get-status` | Compatibility helper for Telegram status. |
| `startTelegram()` | `channels:telegram:start` | Save current config and start Telegram polling. |
| `stopTelegram()` | `channels:telegram:stop` | Stop Telegram polling. |
| `restartTelegram()` | `channels:telegram:restart` | Stop and start Telegram polling with current config. |
| `onStatusChanged(callback)` | `channels:status-changed` | Subscribe to runtime status broadcasts. |

`ChannelsIpc` validates channel ids with `normalizeChannelId()` before reading
or writing config. Unsupported ids throw an IPC error.

The renderer currently exposes runtime controls only for Telegram. Generic
`startChannel()`, `stopChannel()`, and `restartChannel()` methods exist on
`ChannelRegistry` for tests and future host code, but they are not renderer IPC
APIs yet.

## Registry And Plugin Lifecycle

`ChannelRegistry` owns registered plugins, runtime factories, active adapters,
channel configs, and the status cache.

Startup behavior:

1. Register catalog-only plugins for every catalog entry.
2. Register the Telegram runtime plugin, overriding the catalog-only Telegram
   entry.
3. Register the lazy Telegram runtime factory, which imports the adapter only
   when Telegram is started.
4. Register any injected runtime factories from tests or future host code.

Runtime start behavior:

1. Resolve and validate the canonical channel id.
2. Persist or reuse the channel config.
3. Resolve the plugin and default account.
4. Skip start if the account is disabled, unconfigured, or the channel has no
   runtime factory.
5. Create the adapter, subscribe to adapter status and message events, and call
   `adapter.start()`.

Status events are cached, emitted on the main event bus as `channel:status`,
and broadcast to the renderer as `channels:status-changed`.

## Unified Gateway Contract

`ChannelRegistry` is Friday's only agent-facing message gateway for channel
traffic. Provider runtimes may use webhooks, polling, WebSockets, local device
bridges, or hosted APIs, but the agent must only receive and send the shared
channel message shapes.

Every runtime provider must implement the same boundary:

| Direction | Provider responsibility | Shared format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message in | Receive provider events, validate provider authentication, deduplicate platform message ids, preserve provider facts in `provenance`, and emit the raw channel message through `ChannelAdapter.onMessage()`. | `ChannelInboundMessage` |
| Agent dispatch | Let `runChannelTurn()` resolve the account, normalize the inbound message, apply security and admission policy, record diagnostics, call `AgentService.send()`, and resolve the reply route. | `ChannelNormalizedInboundMessage` |
| Message out | Accept sends only through `ChannelRegistry.send()`, map `to`, `threadId`, and `replyToMessageId` to the provider API, and return a delivery result. | `ChannelOutboundMessage` to `ChannelMessageReceipt` |

Do not add provider-specific agent dispatch paths, provider-specific renderer
send IPC, or direct `AgentService` calls inside a provider runtime.
Provider-specific fields belong in config, target parsing, `provenance`, and
receipts. Catalog-only providers must keep runtime capabilities disabled until
they can satisfy this gateway contract.

## Inbound Flow

For runtime channels, inbound messages follow this path:

1. The platform adapter receives a platform event and emits a
   `ChannelInboundMessage`. This is the only provider-to-agent message-in
   entry point.
2. `ChannelRegistry.handleMessage()` resolves the plugin, account id, and saved
   config.
3. `runChannelTurn()` resolves the configured account.
4. The plugin normalizes the raw message to a
   `ChannelNormalizedInboundMessage`.
5. `resolveIngressAdmission()` evaluates the plugin security adapter.
6. Allowed messages are recorded and dispatched to `AgentService.send()`.
7. The registry resolves the reply target and sends the agent reply through the
   channel adapter.

Admission outcomes:

- `dispatch`: send to the agent.
- `handled`: accepted by the channel layer but not dispatched, for example a
  pairing-required direct message.
- `observeOnly`: observed but not dispatched, for example a mention miss.
- `drop`: rejected before agent dispatch.

Ingress diagnostics intentionally include channel, account, chat type, and
reason only. Raw sender ids and route ids are not copied into diagnostics.

## Outbound Flow

Outbound sends use `ChannelOutboundMessage`:

```ts
await channelRegistry.send({
	type: 'telegram',
	accountId: 'default',
	to: '-1001234567890',
	threadId: '42',
	replyToMessageId: '101',
	text: 'Hello from Friday',
	idempotencyKey: 'example:reply',
});
```

The registry requires a running adapter for the target channel. Catalog-only
channels reject sends because they have no active runtime adapter.

Durable send helpers return `ChannelMessageReceipt` with:

- `sent` when every part was delivered.
- `partial` when some parts were delivered before a failure.
- `failed` when nothing was delivered.

## Telegram Runtime

Telegram is implemented with `grammy`.

Current behavior:

- Uses long polling with `drop_pending_updates: true`.
- Emits `connecting`, `connected`, `disconnected`, and `error` status updates.
- Runs a `getMe()` health check every 60 seconds.
- Reconnects with exponential backoff from 2 seconds up to 60 seconds.
- Receives plain text messages only.
- Ignores slash commands before agent dispatch.
- Deduplicates inbound messages by Telegram-derived idempotency key.
- Infers chat type from Telegram chat type and forum topic id.
- Builds session keys as `telegram:<accountId>:<chatId>[:<threadId>]`.
- Sends replies to the original chat, thread, and message id when present.
- Splits outbound text into Telegram's 4096-character message limit.

Telegram target strings can be explicit:

```text
telegram:<chatId>
telegram:<accountId>/<chatId>
telegram:<accountId>/<chatId>#<threadId>
```

Negative Telegram ids generally represent groups or supergroups. Thread ids map
to Telegram forum topic message thread ids.

## Adding A Runtime Channel

Use the existing Telegram plugin as the template.

1. Add or verify the id in `CHANNEL_PROVIDER_IDS`.
2. Add catalog metadata in `CHANNEL_CATALOG_INPUT`, including aliases,
   markdown capability, exposure, docs path defaults, and `brandIconId` when a
   local brand icon should be used.
3. Define a shared config shape only if the generic account shape is not
   enough.
4. Implement a `ChannelPlugin` with config, setup, security, messaging,
   threading, and doctor adapters.
5. Implement a runtime `ChannelAdapter` as the provider gateway with `start()`,
   `stop()`, `send()`, `onMessage()`, and `onStatus()`. It must convert
   provider message-in events to `ChannelInboundMessage` and convert
   `ChannelOutboundMessage` sends to provider API calls that return
   `ChannelMessageReceipt`.
6. Register the plugin and runtime factory in `ChannelRegistry`.
7. Add IPC helpers only when generic `saveChannelConfig()` and `getStatus()` are
   not enough.
8. Update Settings UI only for fields, runtime actions, or status behavior that
   need channel-specific controls.
9. Add tests for catalog normalization, config normalization, ingress admission,
   message normalization, durable sends, registry start/stop/send behavior, and
   any target parsing rules.
10. Add or update the per-channel docs page, official docs links in the catalog
    table above, and brand icon assets/tests if `brandIconId` is set.

Do not bypass `ChannelRegistry`, `ChannelRegistry.send()`, or
`runChannelTurn()` for agent message-in or message-out. That path keeps account
resolution, security policy, diagnostics, and reply routing consistent across
runtimes.
