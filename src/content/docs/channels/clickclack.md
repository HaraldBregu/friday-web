Catalog metadata for Friday's ClickClack channel.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Channel id | `clickclack` |
| Label | ClickClack |
| Aliases | none |
| Runtime | Catalog-only |

ClickClack can be configured in Settings, but Friday does not currently bundle a
ClickClack runtime adapter.

## Implementation Contract

Implement this provider behind Friday's unified channel gateway described in
[Channel subsystem](/docs/channels/#unified-gateway-contract). Provider runtimes must
convert message-in events to `ChannelInboundMessage`, accept message-out
requests as `ChannelOutboundMessage`, and return `ChannelMessageReceipt`
delivery results. Provider-specific ids, thread metadata, and raw payload facts
should stay in normalized fields and `provenance`; the agent must not receive
provider-specific message shapes or be called directly by the runtime.

Catalog-only status should remain until that gateway contract is implemented.
