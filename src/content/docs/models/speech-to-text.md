This document describes how Friday should use speech-to-text models for live
dictation and other audio transcription features.

## Main Process Module

Speech to text should be a separated module in the main process. The renderer
should not know which provider or model is used, and IPC handlers should only
translate renderer calls into module calls.

The main-process speech-to-text module owns:

- Reading its saved settings from `StoreService`.
- Resolving the configured provider record from `StoreService`.
- Loading provider credentials and base URL from the configured provider record.
- Selecting the correct speech-to-text runtime adapter for the provider and
  model.
- Normalizing provider-specific transcript events into Friday transcription
  events.
- Closing sessions when the renderer goes away.

Provider-specific code belongs behind adapters inside this module. For example,
an OpenAI realtime adapter can use OpenAI-specific socket setup internally, but
the speech-to-text module contract remains provider-neutral.

## Service And Tool Exposure

Speech to text can be exposed as both a service and an LLM tool. Live dictation
uses the service path today. A future LLM tool must stay a thin wrapper around
the speech-to-text service and must not accept provider credentials, base URLs,
or raw provider records.

## Supported Providers And Models

Speech to text is not limited to a single provider or model. Any configured
provider can be used if Friday has a speech-to-text adapter for it and the
selected model supports speech-to-text input.

The Settings model picker should show provider/model choices that have a
speech-to-text capability. Saving `speechToText` should validate capability
compatibility, not a hard-coded provider id.

Current catalog status:

- `openai` has the concrete `gpt-realtime-whisper` transcription model.
- Other speech-to-text capable providers use the placeholder
  `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` model id until provider-specific
  catalogs and adapters are implemented.

Cataloged speech-to-text provider/model choices:

| Provider     | Model id                              | Runtime style             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `openai`     | `gpt-realtime-whisper`                | Realtime streaming        |
| `google`     | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |
| `xai`        | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |
| `mistral`    | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |
| `qwen`       | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |
| `elevenlabs` | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |
| `deepgram`   | `speech-to-text-provider-coming-soon` | Placeholder catalog entry |

Some providers may require more than one model identifier internally. For
example, an OpenAI realtime adapter can open a socket with one realtime model
and select a transcription model in the session config:

- `gpt-realtime-whisper` is the configured transcription model stored in
  `speechToText` and sent in the adapter's transcription config.
- `gpt-realtime` is the OpenAI realtime WebSocket connection model used by
  that adapter.

Do not make that adapter detail the global speech-to-text contract. Other
providers may use only one model id, a batch endpoint, a streaming endpoint, or
a local model.

## Module Settings

The speech-to-text module stores provider and model ids at the root
`speechToText` key:

```ts
{
	providerId: 'openai',
	modelId: 'gpt-realtime-whisper',
}
```

Credentials are not stored on `speechToText`. The API key, base URL, and any
other private provider configuration are resolved from the stored provider
record when transcription starts.

Settings can read and save `speechToText` through Settings IPC. Compatibility
IPC still exists:

- `provider:get-speech-transcriber-service`
- `provider:save-speech-transcriber-service`

Both save paths should enforce the same rules:

- Provider id must reference a configured provider.
- Model id must be valid for that provider and support speech to text.
- Saved model data is reduced to `{ id, name }`.

## Startup And Settings

The first-run setup page can save `speechToText` automatically when a
speech-to-text capable provider is connected and a transcription model is
selected.

The Settings module details page also supports the same selection:

1. It loads configured providers.
2. It filters available providers to providers with speech-to-text capable
   models.
3. It uses the selected provider's speech-to-text capable model list as the
   model picker list.
4. It saves through the speech-to-text settings preload API.

## Runtime Flow

Live dictation uses the preload API:

```ts
const session = await window.realtimeTranscription.start({ language: 'en' });
window.realtimeTranscription.appendAudio(session.id, audioBase64);
await window.realtimeTranscription.finish(session.id);
```

Runtime startup:

1. `realtime-transcription:start` loads saved speech-to-text settings from
   `StoreService`.
2. The main process verifies that the speech-to-text settings are configured.
3. It reads `providerId` and `modelId` from `speechToText`.
4. It loads API key, base URL, and provider configuration from
   `StoreService.getProviderById(providerId)`.
5. It creates the speech-to-text adapter for the selected provider and model.
6. The adapter starts a realtime or batch transcription session.
7. Friday forwards normalized transcript events back to the renderer.

If any required setting is missing, startup fails before audio is streamed.

## Audio Format

Renderer capture:

- `useRealtimeDictation()` requests microphone audio with echo cancellation,
  noise suppression, and one channel.
- The renderer creates an `AudioContext` using the session sample rate returned
  by the main process.
- Audio frames are converted to 16-bit PCM and base64 encoded before IPC send.

Main-process session config:

- Input format: PCM audio.
- Sample rate: `REALTIME_TRANSCRIPTION_SAMPLE_RATE`, currently `24000`.
- Turn detection: disabled.
- Optional language: normalized BCP-47-style two-letter language with optional
  region, for example `en` or `en-US`.

Commit thresholds:

- Minimum commit size is 100 ms of PCM16 audio.
- Streaming commit size is 300 ms of PCM16 audio.
- `appendAudio` commits automatically once the streaming threshold is reached.
- `finish` commits any remaining audio if it meets the minimum threshold.

## Events

The main process forwards realtime transcription events to the renderer as
`RealtimeTranscriptionEvent`:

- `started`: session was created and configured.
- `delta`: partial transcript text arrived.
- `committed`: an audio buffer commit was accepted.
- `completed`: final transcript text arrived for an item.
- `error`: socket or transcription error.
- `closed`: session closed.

`useRealtimeDictation()` applies transcript updates to the prompt input. It
keeps the original prompt text as a base, appends partial/final transcript text,
and cancels or finishes the realtime session when the user stops recording.

## Failure Cases

Common startup failures:

- Speech-to-text module settings are not configured.
- Saved provider is missing.
- Saved model is missing or does not support speech to text for that provider.
- Provider credentials are missing.
- No speech-to-text adapter exists for the selected provider/model pair.
- The provider connection or transcription session times out.

Common runtime behavior:

- If the renderer is destroyed, the session is closed.
- If the session owner does not match the IPC sender, finish/cancel fails.
- A too-small input audio buffer error during intentional close is treated as a
  clean close.
- Other socket or transcription errors are sent to the renderer as `error`
  events.
