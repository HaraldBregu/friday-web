Friday does not lock you to one built-in model. You connect the providers you want by adding your own API keys, and each capability keeps its own saved selection.

| Model service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Assistant | The chat and agent brain. |
| Speech-to-Text | Transcription and dictation. |
| Text-to-Speech | Spoken assistant replies. |
| Text-to-Image | Image generation. |
| Text-to-Video | Video generation. |
| Music / Audio | Music and sound-effect generation. |

Scheduled work and health checks have their own provider and model selections, configured on their own Settings pages rather than during first-run setup.

The provider key manager carries 24 catalog entries, each with capability labels and a link to that vendor's key or setup page: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, Z.ai, MiniMax, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Cartesia, Black Forest Labs, Midjourney, Kling, Runway, Luma, Stability AI, Ideogram, Pika, Suno, Reka, and Perplexity.

## Chat Routing

Friday uses the native Anthropic Messages API for Anthropic, the OpenAI Responses API for OpenAI, and the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions path for every other chat provider, which is also how you connect an OpenAI-compatible endpoint of your own.

## Speech

Realtime and recorded transcription keep independent saved selections, and Settings filters models by whether they implement streaming or batch transcription. Batch audio is capped at 64 MiB of encoded input; realtime chunks at 256 KiB.

The audio catalog presents six providers, but only ElevenLabs and Stability AI currently execute.

Realtime-voice models are also cataloged for Google, Luma, Qwen, and xAI, but there is no realtime-voice execution service behind them. Friday's voice API today is text-to-speech.

## Credentials

API keys live in Friday's local application data and are masked in the interface after saving. Requests and credentials still go to the configured provider as required for authentication and inference. See [Privacy And Security](/docs/privacy) for how those files are stored.

## Choosing Providers

Mix providers for quality, cost, and speed: one for assistant chat, another for transcription, another for images. Because every capability keeps its own selection, changing one does not disturb the others.
