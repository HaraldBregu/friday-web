This document describes how the task scheduler module should create, persist,
and evaluate schedules.

## Module Contract

The task scheduler is a separated Friday module. It owns timing, schedule
persistence, due-run processing, retry policy, concurrency policy, audit events,
and the LLM-facing `cron` tool.

Module surfaces:

- Service/facade: `CronService` in the main process.
- LLM tool: `cron`.
- Renderer IPC: `cron:*` channels.
- Storage: root `taskScheduler` settings.

Dependencies:

- `StoreService` and `CronScheduleStore` for persisted schedule state.
- Clock/timer utilities and cron-expression calculation.
- Task execution modules for the work that runs after a schedule fires.
- `AgentService` only for Friday cron jobs that intentionally run an agent
  turn.
- Event and audit modules for lifecycle reporting.

The scheduler does not own provider or model selection for model-backed work.
Provider-backed execution belongs to the module that performs the work.

## Purpose

The task scheduler owns scheduled work in the main process. It supports three
related scheduling paths:

- Managed schedules through `CronSchedulerService`.
- Friday LLM tool schedules through `FridayCronScheduler`.
- Legacy `node-cron` jobs through `CronService.schedule()`.

Managed schedules are the richer schedule model. They include permissions,
auditing, persistence, missed-run handling, concurrency policy, retries, and
execution records.

Friday tool schedules are the user-facing agent cron jobs handled by the `cron`
tool. They store a compact job definition and run agent turns or system events.

The legacy `node-cron` path schedules a persisted expression and handler
directly. It remains available for simple cron tasks.

## Managed Schedule Creation

Managed schedules are created through `CronService.createSchedule(request,
actor)`, which delegates to `CronSchedulerService.createSchedule()`.

Renderer callers use the `cron:createSchedule` IPC channel. The IPC handler
validates the minimum request shape, defaults the source to `ui` when needed,
builds a UI actor, and calls `cron.createSchedule()`.

Agent callers use `AgentCronService.createScheduleFromAgent()`. That helper
fills the agent source fields:

- `source: 'agent'`
- `sourceId: agentContext.agentId`
- `createdBy: agentContext.agentId`
- `ownerUserId`, `sessionId`, `timezone`, and `visibility` from the agent
  context or request

The managed creation flow is:

1. Authorize the actor for `createSchedule`.
2. Validate frequency limits through the access policy.
3. Validate the schedule shape with `validateScheduleShape()`.
4. Reject secret-looking keys inside `taskInput`.
5. Build a full `CronSchedule` record from the create request.
6. Compute the first `nextRunAt` with `CronNextRunCalculator`.
7. Add a `schedule.created` audit entry.
8. Persist the schedule with `CronScheduleStore.createSchedule()`.
9. Append and emit a `schedule.created` event.

## Managed Schedule Request

The create request should use this shape:

Required fields:

```ts
{
	name: string;
	type: CronScheduleType;
	source: CronScheduleSource;
	createdBy: string;
	timezone: string;
	taskType: string;
	taskInput: CronJsonValue;
}
```

Schedule-specific required fields:

- `type: 'cron'` requires `cronExpression`.
- `type: 'interval'`, `type: 'fixedRate'`, and `type: 'fixedDelay'` require
  `intervalMs`.
- `type: 'oneTime'` requires `runAt`.
- `type: 'calendar'` and `type: 'manual'` do not currently produce automatic
  next runs.

Common optional fields:

- Ownership and visibility: `ownerUserId`, `sessionId`, `visibility`.
- Bounds: `startAt`, `endAt`, `maxRuns`.
- Missed-run behavior: `missedRunPolicy`, `maxCatchUpRuns`,
  `catchUpWindowMs`.
- Concurrency behavior: `concurrencyPolicy`.
- Retry behavior: `retryPolicy`.
- Task metadata: `taskPriority`, `taskTags`, `taskMetadata`.
- Security: `requiredPermissions`, `requiresConfirmation`,
  `confirmationPolicy`.
- State: `enabled`, `metadata`.

## Managed Schedule Defaults

`CronSchedulerService.createSchedule()` fills these defaults:

- `id`: generated UUID.
- `status`: `active` unless `enabled` is explicitly `false`, then `disabled`.
- `ownerUserId`: request value or actor user id.
- `sessionId`: request value or actor session id.
- `visibility`: `user`.
- `timezone`: request timezone, actor timezone, or scheduler default timezone.
- `runCount`: `0`.
- `missedRunPolicy`: `skip`.
- `maxCatchUpRuns`: scheduler run policy default.
- `catchUpWindowMs`: scheduler run policy default.
- `concurrencyPolicy`: `skipIfRunning`.
- `retryPolicy`: scheduler default retry policy merged with the request retry
  policy.
- `taskPriority`: `normal`.
- `taskTags`: empty array.
- `taskMetadata`: empty object.
- `requiredPermissions`: empty array.
- `requiresConfirmation`: `false`.
- `enabled`: `true`.
- `metadata`: empty object.
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: current ISO timestamp.

The cron expression is normalized by trimming it and collapsing repeated
whitespace.

## Next Run Calculation

`CronNextRunCalculator.getNextRun(schedule, from)` calculates the next run
based on the schedule type.

For `cron` schedules:

- The expression must use 5 fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of
  week.
- Fields support `*`, comma lists, ranges, and step values.
- Time matching is evaluated in the schedule timezone through
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- The calculator starts at the next full minute after `from`.
- It scans forward up to 366 days.
- If both day-of-month and day-of-week are restricted, either may match.
- If only one of day-of-month or day-of-week is restricted, both normal cron
  fields must match.

For interval schedules:

- `interval` uses the last run/evaluation/start/create time as the base.
- `fixedRate` uses the original start/create anchor as the base.
- `fixedDelay` schedules after the last successful run, last run, start, or
  create time.

For one-time schedules:

- `runAt` is returned only if it is in the future, the schedule has not run,
  and the schedule is not completed.

For all managed schedule types:

- Disabled or deleted schedules return no next run.
- Schedules at `maxRuns` return no next run.
- `startAt`, `endAt`, and `maxRuns` bounds are enforced.

## Runtime Processing

`CronSchedulerService.start()` recovers schedules on startup, then checks due
schedules every `pollIntervalMs` milliseconds. The default poll interval is 30
seconds.

Due processing works like this:

1. Load active schedules whose `nextRunAt` is due.
2. Limit the batch to `runPolicy.maxRunsPerTurn`.
3. Acquire a per-schedule lock.
4. Re-read and validate that the schedule can still run.
5. Emit `schedule.due`.
6. Build an idempotency key from `scheduleId` and `scheduledRunAt`.
7. Ignore duplicate executions or already-created tasks.
8. Apply the concurrency policy.
9. Create a scheduled task through the runner, with retries if configured.
10. Increment `runCount`, update `lastRunAt`, recompute `nextRunAt`, and mark
    completed schedules.
11. Record an execution and emit `schedule.triggered`.

The default runner is `InMemoryCronScheduleRunner`. It creates a
`CronScheduledTask` with:

- `source: 'cron'`
- `sourceId`: schedule id
- `type`: schedule `taskType`
- `input`: redacted schedule `taskInput`
- metadata containing the scheduled time, actual trigger time, run number,
  missed-run flag, runner id, and idempotency key

## Module-Backed Scheduled Work

The task scheduler owns timing, persistence, and due-run processing. It does
not own provider or model selection for model-backed work.

When a schedule triggers module-backed work, the schedule stores the task type
and sanitized task input only. The task handler or target main-process module
resolves its own provider, model, endpoint, and runtime dependencies when it
executes.

Persisted module settings are storage details. Schedules should depend on task
types and sanitized inputs, not on other module settings keys.

Recommended module task types:

- `text-to-speech.run`: calls the text-to-speech module.
- `image.create`: calls the image module.
- `video.create`: calls the video module.
- `sound.create`: calls the sound module.
- `ocr.run`: calls the OCR module or the configured OCR endpoint.
- `embedding.index`: calls the embedding module when that module exists.

Cron payloads must not store API keys, base URLs, webhook secrets, or raw
provider records. If a future scheduled task supports a provider/model
override, the payload may contain only ids; credentials and full provider
configuration must still be resolved from `StoreService`.

Example media schedule:

```ts
await cron.createSchedule({
	name: 'Create weekly product image',
	type: 'cron',
	source: 'agent',
	sourceId: 'agent',
	createdBy: 'agent',
	visibility: 'user',
	timezone: 'Europe/Rome',
	cronExpression: '0 8 * * 1',
	missedRunPolicy: 'skip',
	concurrencyPolicy: 'skipIfRunning',
	taskType: 'image.create',
	taskInput: {
		prompt: 'Create a square product image for the weekly announcement.',
		aspectRatio: '1:1',
		count: 1,
	},
});
```

When this schedule fires, the task scheduler creates or dispatches an
`image.create` task. The image task calls the image module, and the image module
reads its saved settings to choose the provider and model.

## Missed Runs

Startup recovery handles schedules whose persisted `nextRunAt` is already in
the past.

Policies:

- `skip`: compute the next future run and emit `schedule.skipped`.
- `runOnce`: trigger one missed run.
- `catchUp`: trigger missed runs within the catch-up window, limited by
  `maxCatchUpRuns` and `maxRunsPerTurn`.
- `fail`: mark the schedule failed.
- `askUser`: currently triggers the missed run.

## Concurrency Policies

When a schedule is due and a previous task is still running:

- `allowOverlap`: create another task.
- `skipIfRunning`: record a skipped execution and move to the next run.
- `queueIfRunning`: currently proceeds to create the next task.
- `cancelPrevious`: cancel running tasks, then create the new task.
- `replacePrevious`: cancel running tasks, then create the new task.

## Friday Tool Schedule Creation

Friday cron jobs are created through `CronService.fridayAction(request, actor,
context)`, which delegates to `FridayCronScheduler.handleToolAction()`.

The normal add flow is:

1. Normalize the raw tool request with `normalizeFridayCronToolRequest()`.
2. Convert the add payload into a `FridayCronAddRequest`.
3. Validate the actor can add jobs.
4. Load the Friday cron store snapshot.
5. Create a `FridayCronJobDefinition`.
6. Validate the job with `assertValidFridayJob()`.
7. Create default job state.
8. Compute `state.nextRunAtMs` when the job is enabled.
9. Save the snapshot.
10. Arm the next timer.

Friday schedules support three schedule shapes:

```ts
type FridayCronSchedule =
	| { kind: 'at'; at: string }
	| { kind: 'every'; everyMs: number; anchorMs?: number }
	| { kind: 'cron'; expr: string; tz?: string; staggerMs?: number };
```

Normalization accepts compact forms:

- `at` or `atMs` creates `{ kind: 'at' }`.
- `everyMs` creates `{ kind: 'every' }`.
- `expr` or `cron` creates `{ kind: 'cron' }`.
- `tz` sets the cron timezone.
- `exact: true` disables stagger by setting `staggerMs` to `0`.

Friday next-run calculation works like this:

- `at`: returns the timestamp until it has run once.
- `every`: advances from `anchorMs` or job creation time by `everyMs`, bounded
  by the scheduler minimum refire gap.
- `cron`: reuses `CronNextRunCalculator` by wrapping the Friday job as a
  temporary managed cron schedule, then adds `staggerMs` when present.

## Legacy Node-Cron Jobs

`CronService.schedule(id, expression, data, handler, options)` uses the
`node-cron` package directly.

Creation flow:

1. Reject duplicate job ids.
2. Validate the cron expression with `node-cron`.
3. Build a persisted `CronTask` record.
4. If automatic cron execution is disabled, persist the task without arming it.
5. Otherwise call `cron.schedule(expression, handler, { timezone })`.
6. Store the registered job in memory.
7. Persist the task through `StoreService`.
8. Optionally run the handler immediately when `runOnStart` is set.

Persisted legacy tasks are restored with `CronService.restore(dispatcher)`.
Restore validates each expression, recreates the `node-cron` schedule, and
dispatches through the supplied handler.

## Disabling Automatic Execution

Automatic execution is disabled when either condition is true:

- `SKIP_CRON=1`
- `CRON_ENABLED=false`

When disabled, managed scheduler execution is not started and Friday cron
timers are not armed. Legacy jobs are still persisted, but their timers are not
scheduled.

## Example Managed Schedule

```ts
await cron.createSchedule({
	name: 'Review invoices reminder',
	type: 'cron',
	source: 'agent',
	sourceId: 'agent',
	createdBy: 'agent',
	visibility: 'user',
	timezone: 'Europe/Rome',
	cronExpression: '0 9 * * 1',
	missedRunPolicy: 'skip',
	concurrencyPolicy: 'skipIfRunning',
	taskType: 'reminder.show',
	taskInput: { message: 'Review invoices' },
});
```

This creates an active schedule that runs every Monday at 09:00 in the
`Europe/Rome` timezone. During creation, the scheduler validates the cron
expression, computes the first `nextRunAt`, persists the schedule, and emits
`schedule.created`.
